# graphviz-to-svg-action

Github Action that takes a dot file as input and generates a svg.

I hope to create diagrams like the following mindmap with it:

# Tools used

 - ubuntu image (is there a debian one?)
 - Python3
 - probably this lib: https://pypi.org/project/pydot/
 - for animation this lib: https://pypi.org/project/drawsvg/ (this might end up becoming another action tho)
